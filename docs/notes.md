What is a Git Branch?
In Git, a branch is like a separate workspace where you can make changes and try new ideas without affecting the main project. Think of it as a "parallel universe" for your code.

Why Use Branches?
Branches let you work on different parts of a project, like new features or bug fixes, without interfering with the main branch.

Common Reasons to Create a Branch
Developing a new feature
Fixing a bug
Experimenting with ideas
